# Statistic for P116
+ The P116 version of the statistic code is slightly different compared to the previous versions.

+ For this semester, we lost time to the dome repair, starting November 20th, 2025:   until January 10, 2026

+ **12.01.2026:** I counted the number of available nights for the monitoring programs, but they might need corrections by 2-3 nights. That will not change the statistic by a lot.
