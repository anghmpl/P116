# Statistic for P116
+ The P116 version of the statistic code is slightly different compared to the previous versions.

+ For this semester, we lost time to the dome repair, starting November 20th, 2025:   until January 10, 2026

+ **12.01.2026:** I counted the number of available nights for the monitoring programs, but they might need corrections by 2-3 nights. That will not change the statistic by a lot.

+ **26.01.2026:** New version, counting only data taken between 01.10.2025- 20.11.2025 and 20.01.2026 and wahthever "last night" was date-wise.
+ Sarah Bosman does not have an individual PID, but Eduardo Bañados is on her proposal. He has 2 PIDs for GROND, but uses only one. I put the second one for Sarah, but she is category B, and not scheduled to get time in the most recent schedule from Roland.
+ There is now a separate block for each instrument, if you want to check the numbers against what can be found via the ESO archive. Just change PID and name.
+ **27.01.2026:** Small correction  for the FEROS counts, before dome repair files were counted twice, fixed now.
+ **12.02.2026:** Replaced the old version with a new one, GROND statistics for Wang and Bañados work. You can check an individual PID with the separate scripts at the end. There is one for WFI, FEROS and GROND.
